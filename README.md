# ✅ DSA_Interview_Prep

This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving **100+ essential DSA problems** to strengthen my **problem-solving skills** and prepare for **placements & interviews**.  

I’ll start with **fundamentals** (arrays, strings, hashing, searching, sorting, recursion, etc.) and gradually move to **advanced concepts** (trees, graphs, DP).  
The goal is to build a strong foundation and improve **time & space complexity analysis**, coding speed, and confidence.
